# Course-Project-1

This is my repository for the Coursera's first course project "Exploratory Data Analysis". Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. My task was to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system. It has 4 plots and the corresponding codes for making the four plots.

To run this script you need to to the following:

*  Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;
*  Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
*  Extract the data into ./Data subdirectory;
*  Run the scripts
